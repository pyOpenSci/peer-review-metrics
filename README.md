# README: About pyOpenSci peer review metrics

This is a dashboard created using mystmd [![Made with MyST](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-myst-orange)](https://myst.tools). Myst-md is a community developed
tool that makes it easier for scientists to create fully reproducible (and interactive)
workflows and reports that are easily shared.

## How to use this repository

To work with this repository do the following:

First, create & activate a fresh Python environment.

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate pyos-myst
```

## 2. Install nodejs

Next, install `nodejs` & `mystmd`.

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge 'nodejs>=20,<21' mystmd
```

## Local preview

Finally preview this locally:

Run `myst` to create a run a local live server  that will update as you
update your code / workflows.

To build the html files and run code use:

`myst build --execute` to execute code`

To build a local server that runs and executes code:
`myst start --execute`

## When i tried to use md files to executive code (which is preferred) it couldn't find the kernel

🪐 Jupyter server did not start
Unable to instantiate connection to Jupyter Server

If we use juyter then we want to ensure

jupyterlab_myst is installed to be able to use eval statements

`myst start --execute`
to run and execute code.

To run - jupyterlab_myst

## Environment

use the environment.yml file

`>> myst`

you will get:

```
Welcome to the MyST Markdown CLI!! 🎉 🚀

myst init walks you through creating a myst.yml file.

You can use myst to:

 - create interactive websites from markdown and Jupyter Notebooks 📈
 - build & export professional PDFs and Word documents 📄

## Build using Nox

You can use nox to build the dashboard locally. Nox will
create an environment for you with all needed dependencies.

To start, install [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/):

Using `pip`:

`python -m pip install nox`

or [`pipx` for global install](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/):

`pipx install nox`

### Build a static html website

To build the html version of the dashboard use

`nox -s build`

### Build a live local server dashboard

To build the dashboard as a local server that will update
as you update the files use:

`nox -s serve`

One a mac you can use `ctrl + d` to stop a live server.
